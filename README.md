# balthasar

`balthasar` is the frontend portion of project magi. It focuses on presenting information in a convenient format as efficiently as possible.

The project is currently in very early development. Overall structure is likely to change as the project grows.

## Development

To install dependencies:
`npm install`

To run a dev deployment with `vite`:
`npm run dev`

At the moment, balthasar expects [casper](https://github.com/Drowrin/casper) to be running at `localhost:3001`. In the future, this will be configurable for dev builds.
